At present I am a [Rutherford Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellow](https://royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/rutherford-foundation/rutherford-foundation-recipients/matthew-nitschke/), awarded by the Royal Society of New Zealand (2019-2021), and am based at the School of Biological Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. I am also a member of the Future Reefs team within the Climate Change Cluster (C3), at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia. My research interests relate to all things coral reefs, from broad-scale ecology through to the functioning of single cells. I specialise in the phylogenetic diversity and functioning of coral symbionts, most notably of the dinoflagellate family Symbiodiniaceae. In my research I leverage next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics, bio-optical probes and models, and photogrammetry.
